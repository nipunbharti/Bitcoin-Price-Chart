# Bitcoin-Price-Chart
A live chart displaying the Bitcoin price in USD.

Made using ReactJS, NodeJS and MongoDB.
Using `request`, an API call is made to retrieve the Bitcoin price and then the price is stored in MongoDB using `mongoose` along with it's time stamp.
And then that data stored is visualised in a chart using `ReactJS`.
